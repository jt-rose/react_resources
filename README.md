One of the best parts of React is the rich ecosystem of libraries that comes with it. Below are some useful ones you may want to consider for your next React project.

## Component Libraries
Component libraries give you premade components that you can adjust via props/ hooks. These can be useful to give nice default styling and functionality, such as quickly building a Bootstrap-styled accordion.

- [Bootstrap React]
- [Chakra UI]
- [Semantic UI]
- [Material UI]
- [ANT]

## Animation
Frmer Motion allows you to add animations to elements on various effects, which helps to make your site feel smoother and more responsive.

- [Framer-Motion]

## Data Visualization
- [Victory]
- [React Charts]

## CSS in JS
It's not for everyone, but for devs who want to bundle their CSS directly with their React components, both of these libraries are helpful - just be mindful that they create component scoped CSS, which effectively gets rid of the "Cascade" aspect of CSS

- [Styled Components]
- [Styled JSX]

## Routing
React Router can be used for imitating traditional pages and routing in React. The NextJS framework (listed below) can also help with this.

- [React Router]

## State Management
For managing global state decoupled from components, the modern version of Redux (Redux Toolkit) remains, in my opinion, the best option. 

- [Redux Toolkit]

## Form Management
Form libraries can ease the pain and boilerplate of forms in React.

- [React Hook Form]
- [Formik]

## GraphQL Clients
For those awesome people using a GraphQL server, there are various clients that can work with codegen and greatly simplify frontend development while alos providing a cache if needed. Apollo Client is the best known but is a very heavyweight option. URQL is lighter, but I personally find a little clunky to work with. React Query is a bit newer but strikes me as the best, is lighter than the other two, and has excellent documentation and integration with server-side rendering (SSR) in NextJS.

- [Apollo Client]
- [URQL]
- [React Query]

## Frameworks
All three of these frameworks allow from static site generation (SSG) while NextJS and Remix also allow for server-side rendering (SSR).

- [NextJS]
- [Gatsby]
- [Remix]
